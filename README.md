backbone.io
===========

**This project is deprecated and will no longer be maintained.**  I've taken the best ideas from the project and incorporated them into a more versatile and well-designed library for syncing data via Socket.IO.  You can find it here: [https://github.com/scttnlsn/data.io](https://github.com/scttnlsn/data.io)

Note that [data.io](https://github.com/scttnlsn/data.io) does not depend on [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org) (like [backbone.io](https://github.com/scttnlsn/backbone.io) did) so if you're looking to integrate [data.io](https://github.com/scttnlsn/data.io) with a Backbone project please refer to [this example](https://github.com/scttnlsn/data.io/tree/master/examples/backbone).

If you have any questions or run into issues migrating your code to use [data.io](https://github.com/scttnlsn/data.io), please open an issue in this project's tracker.
